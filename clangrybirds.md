clangrybirds: command-line angry birds
pulls a random scene out of ten scenes
gives you the option to provide a > 0* and < 90* angle and a magnitude
prints frames of bird moving
o = bird
# = pig
| or _ is a surface

angle (degrees, 0<theta<90): 
magnitude (pixels per second, 0<m<80): 
There has to be some relationship between the input direction and magnitude that allows
the sine curve to have its height and length manipulatied appropriately so that the 
parabola that it describes makes sense.
